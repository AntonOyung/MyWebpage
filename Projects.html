    <h2 class="w3-center"><b>Yelp</b></h2>
    <p><b>Spring 2017.</b> I worked on a NLP project analyzing Yelp's academic dataset, a free dataset released by Yelp for their yearly data competition.
    My partner <a href="https://andrew-peng.com">Andrew</a> and I utilized LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), an information retrieval algorithm, to generate a comprehensive overview of the
    customers' thoughts about a given restaurant. </p>
    <p>See our code: <b><a href="https://github.com/AntonOyung/YelpDataset">YelpDataset Repo</a></b></p>
    <p>See our full report: <b><a href="Yelp_Poster.pdf">Yelp Poster</a></b></p>

    <p><b>How We Did It.</b> LDA is an NLP tool that analyzes text data and outputs a set of unobserved topics (groups of words) that are used frequently together and often. In essence, they are
      key words that are used often in the text. Taking these topics over all of the reviews for one restaurant, we used tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) to rank all the reviews
      by their relevance in relation to the topics. Finally using LexRank we were able to draw the most significant sentences and compile them to create one comprehensive review.

    </div>
    <p><b>Our Results.</b>
    We split the reviews into good and bad in order to give the reader a more comprehensive review of both the good and the bad aspects of the restaurant. Our results for one restaurant looks
      like this.</p>
    <p>
      <i>
      The Good:
      “For me, the number one draw was the View not the view of the Paris Hotel & Casino, but the view from the outdoor patio of the
      Bellagio Fountains across the Las Vegas Strip. There are two dining options at Mon Ami Gabi: Indoor or Patio. We were in no rush
      to leave thanks to the Fountains of Bellagio view and relaxed pace of our meal.”
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
      The Bad: “A food runner brought water and bread fairly quickly. Our server made an appearance about 10 minutes after we were seated. 
      I thought maybe the food would make up for the lack of good customer service here, but it didn't. We were here no later than 10:55 and
      I called ahead of time but the fact that I had to wait in that ridiculous line to check in so I was 30 minutes “late”.”
