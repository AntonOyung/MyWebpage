    <h2 class="w3-center"><b>Binwise Inc.</b></h2>
    <p>My 2016 summer I worked as a statistical programmer intern at a small SF-based company called Binwise.
     Binwise, a wine inventory tracking B2B company, deals with the sales data from top restaurants all across the nation.
     During my time at Binwise I was purposed with the task of analyzing the sales data. I taught myself to use tools such
     as SQL Server Management Studio and Rstudio and utilized Python in order to produce revenue generating business
     intelligence reports and model sales data. Working at Binwise was an excellent opportunity for me to get work experience
     in a real dev environment and the intimate corporate atmosphere allowed me to interact closely with everyone on the
     dev team.</p>

    <h3><b>What they had to say:</b></h3>
    <p>"Anton is the most capable intern I ever had the pleasure to manage.
       His defining qualities that made the internship such a success are his
       intelligence, steadfastness, willingness to learn and great attitude
       all around. He far exceeded all expectations and demonstrated that he
       can work in a production environment having only completed his freshman
       year. He was able, in a matter of months, to spearhead an analytics initiative
       that is currently becoming a revenue-generating product. I would recommend
       Anton to anyone without any reservation."</p>
