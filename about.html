          <h1><b>Lefty, Snowboarder, Gamer</b></h1>
          <p><b>I'm</b> a second year Computer Science and Statistics double major at UC Berkeley. Despite being born and raised in Palo Alto, I come from a household of golden bears!
          In my free time my hobbies include photography, Dragonboat, weightlifting, cooking, design, and coding.</p>

          <p><b>This</b> is me eating yogurt.</p>

          <p><b>Some</b> things I hope to accomplish in my lifetime include: teaching myself to play piano, climbing a mountain, living in Seattle, seeing the Northern lights,
          relearning how to speak Chinese, skydiving (despite my fear of heights/falling/basically everything about it). In the near future I hope to land a
          tech internship for this summer where I can develop my coding skills, gain professional experience, and most importantly find a mentor.</p>

          <p><b>This</b> is my family and me at my most recent Dragonboat race (I'm the one with warpaint on my face).</p>

        <p><b>Dragonboat</b> is an ancient Chinese sport that can most easily be described as competetive canoeing. Every Saturday and Sunday 40+ of us meet up
        at the Jack London Aquatic Center in Oakland to paddle around in large 20-person dragonboats. As strange as it sounds, I could not be more blessed
        to find such a strong, supportive and loving community at Cal during my first semester. What makes me love this goofy, quirky, and perfectly
        imperfect group of paddlers is their love for each other and the sport. Nobody joins dragonboat to pad their resume or land an internship, but
        rather everyone shows up solely for the community and to practice the sport they love.   </p>

        <p><b>This</b> is some of us.</p>
        <p><b>This</b> is what it looks like.</p>
